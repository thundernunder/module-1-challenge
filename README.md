Nathan Underwood - Module 1 Challenge

By refactoring the starter HTML and CSS, I am able to show my knowlegde of basic HTML and CSS prinicples by replacing non-semantic HTML elements with semantic HTML elements, improving specificity within the code. 

This challenge also entailed reordering the HTML and CSS to better reflect the flow of the working webpage, making it easier for future devs to understand the code. 

Here is a screenshot of what the functioning webpage should look like:
