Nathan Underwood - Module 1 Challenge

This completed challenge shows my knowledge of basic HTML and CSS prinicples. The challenge entailed replacing non-semantic HTML elements with semantic HTML elements to improve specificity withint the HTML. 

This challenge also entailed reordering the HTML and CSS to better reflect the flow of the working webpage, making it easier for future devs to understand the code.
